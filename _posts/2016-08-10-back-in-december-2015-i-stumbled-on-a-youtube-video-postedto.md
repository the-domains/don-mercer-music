  Back in December 2015 I stumbled on a YouTube video postedTom Meny about a
  song writing group he was organising. A number of song writers had already
  signed up to a “song a week” project and Tom was talking about how it would
  work. A “prompt” would be emailed out each Monday morning and everyone in the
  group -would have to use that prompt, typically a short phrase, in an original
  song, record and post online by the following Sunday by mid-night. If you
  don’t, then you’re out of the group. I immediately contacted Tom and signed up
  - not truly appreciating that it would impact my weekly routine for the years
  that were to follow. The group would to this for 16 weeks at a time … take a
  short break, a few weeks or so … then start all over again.

Well I'm now at week 5 of the fourth 16 week run and I've written some 40-50 songs since then. Some of them are terrible - but that is not surprising - what is surprising is that some of them are really good ( for my tastes and opinion ) ... my taste and opinion on these songs are really the only valid opinions - because I don't expect to have an audience - I'm doing this for me.

More to come ... 'til then - Don
